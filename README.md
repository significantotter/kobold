**Kobold** - A Pathfinder 2E play by post discord.js bot written with TypeScript.

## Introduction

Kobold integrates the character management tools Pathbuilder 2E and Wanderer's guide into a discord play by post bot. pf2.tools has a lot of flexibility, but it can be annoying to manage, difficult for players to lear to use, and finnicky to get right. More unfortunately, the Wayfinder bot that integrates with pf2.tools is no longer being maintained.

Kobold is being developed with a focus on ease of playing with minimal configuration. However, although the base usage should be simple, I intend to allow as much complexity as a player wishes to utilize with it.
